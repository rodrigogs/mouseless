# Mouseless

Android application using nkzawa's [socket.io-client.java](https://github.com/nkzawa/socket.io-client.java) for communication with [Mouseless Server](https://github.com/rodrigogs/mouseless-server)

Just change the app's configuration to point to a running server ip and port and it's good to go.
